# Trivia-Game

**Description**

Trivia Challenge App using the Open Trivia Database. This app will challenge users with trivia questions spanning a variety of categories and difficulties, providing a dynamic, interactive learning experience. By integrating SwiftUI for the UI and networking to fetch trivia data, students will demonstrate their ability to create complex iOS applications.

The app will dynamically fetch trivia questions and display them to the user in a format that encourages interactionâ€”either through ListView or CardView. This choice allows for flexibility in UI design and user experience, capitalizing on the engaging, responsive UI design capabilities introduced in earlier units.
